# AxiDraw-Processing

Some simple examples showing how one can control the AxiDraw, directly from within Processing.

Issue reports and contributions welcome.


Two examples are currently included:

AxiGen1: Draw a random walk where you click the mouse. This is a good starting point for making generative artwork on the AxiDraw.

AxiRT: Real-time drawing software for the AxiDraw; a derivative of https://github.com/evil-mad/robopaint-rt 
You can draw a sketch with your cursor, and the AxiDraw will draw it onto paper.


See also: https://github.com/ralphcrutzen/AxiTurtle, real-time turtle graphics control of AxiDraw, based on these examples.
